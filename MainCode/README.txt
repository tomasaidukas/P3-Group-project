Text files and images go to the corresponding folders to make less of a mess.

I wrote explanations for each functions and made the format more easily readable.

To run the code and get all the data simply use type "make", then ./main and lastly ./numPlot and ./elPlot


For those who want to contribute:

1. Implement some functions to analyze the speed, accuracy, CPU usage etc.

2. Plot the equipotential lines for numerical solutions

3. Quantify the accuracy as the numerical method as the absolute or percentage difference
between the exact analytical value and the appproximate numerical solution for the po-
tential on the grid of x and y coordinates.

4. Quantify how the difference in potential between two consecutive steps, the CPU com-
suption, and the time vary with the number of iterations.

5. The electric field lines in Gnuplot don't look nice, so need to make them look proper.
